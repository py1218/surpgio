            <b>Sexy Unique RPG</b> is a 16-bit style, top-down RPG inspired by the early seasons of Vanderpump Rules. Set in a pixelated West Hollywood, you play as a new server at SUR (Sexy Unique Restaurant), where the tips are low and the stakes are high.
            <br><br>
            Talk to AI-powered versions of the cast, stir up drama, and try to survive the social minefield of WeHo nightlife, all under the watchful eye of Lisa Vanderpump.
            <br><br>
            The game is a fictionalized take on the Vanderpump Rules universe, with original storylines and scenes that expand over time. Two chaotic episodes are available now, with more on the way.
